## Free Software - Open source

### subtile
I created the crates **[subtile](https://crates.io/crates/subtile)** and **[subtile-ocr](https://crates.io/crates/subtile-ocr)**. They are based on the fork of no longer maintened crates [vobsubocr](https://github.com/elizagamedev/vobsubocr) and [vobsub](https://crates.io/crates/vobsub).

### Ecosystem participation :

For example, I have contributed to such projects as the following: [matroska-demuxer](https://github.com/hasenbanck/matroska-demuxer), [üê¶ puffin](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/puffin), [zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/), [cosmic-files](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-files), [release-plz](https://github.com/release-plz/release-plz), [typos](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos/) or [typos-lsp](https://github.com/tekumara/typos-lsp)
